# Dual Treasury System

### Overview

Altered Paradigm operates on a revolutionary Dual Treasury System, meticulously crafted to navigate through the turbulent waves of the crypto ocean, ensuring stability while exploring avenues for sustained growth. The two treasuries, namely the **Backing Treasury** and the **Investment Treasury**, function harmoniously, each playing a pivotal role in maintaining the intrinsic value of the Altered Paradigm token (ALPA) and steering the project towards profitable ventures, respectively.

### The Backing Treasury

The Backing Treasury acts as a financial bulwark, safeguarding the intrinsic value of the ALPA token. It is a repository that accumulates and holds a substantial portion of stable coins, providing a floor base and directly asserting a minimum value for the token. This treasury ensures that the ecosystem remains resilient amidst market fluctuations and provides a safety net for ALPA holders.

### The Investment Treasury

The Investment Treasury, on the other hand, is the strategic arm of Altered Paradigm, tasked with ensuring the progressive growth of the project. Capital in this treasury is judiciously utilized across a multitude of investment activities, which may include DeFi farming, holding prominent assets such as BTC/ETH, and acquiring tokens that showcase exponential growth potential. The profits generated from these ventures are systematically utilized to further reinforce the Backing Treasury, creating a cycle of stability and growth.
