# Redemption and Floor Price Support

## What is Token Redemption?

In the context of the **Floor Price Mechanism**, Altered Paradigm introduces a strategic approach to token redemption, which directly ties into supporting and maintaining the Floor Price of the ALPA token. Token redemption allows ALPA token holders to exchange their tokens at the floor price, providing an assurance of intrinsic value and stability even amidst market volatility.

## The Redemption Contract

A specific **Redeem Contract** is deployed, which allows users to redeem their ALPA tokens at the current floor price, effectively supporting the price from falling below this threshold.

### How Redemption Works:

1. **Supporting the Floor Price:** The redeem contract allows users to exploit arbitrage opportunities, redeeming their ALPA tokens for stablecoins (or other assets) equivalent to the current floor price, thereby providing active support to the floor price.
2. **Burning Mechanism:** Tokens that are redeemed through the contract are not re-circulated into the market. Instead, they are **burned**, reducing the total circulating supply and subsequently influencing the floor price and token scarcity.

## Strategic Implications:

- **Stability Assurance:** The redemption mechanism assures token holders that they can liquidate their holdings at a price that is at least equal to the floor price, providing a tangible safety net.
- **Price Support:** This mechanism also serves as an automated stabilizer for the ALPA token price, as arbitrageurs will naturally redeem tokens when the market price drops to the floor price, reducing selling pressure and stabilizing the price.

- **Supply Management:** The burning of redeemed tokens impacts the total circulating supply, indirectly influencing the tokenâ€™s scarcity, price dynamics, and the floor price itself.

## Summary: Stability Through Strategic Redemption

The redemption mechanism, integrated with the floor price, exemplifies Altered Paradigm's innovative approach towards ensuring stability, providing tangible safety nets, and actively managing the token's price and supply dynamics. This mechanism not only assures token holders of a minimum value for their tokens but also strategically involves the community in actively managing and supporting the intrinsic value of the ALPA token, forging a path of stability and confidence in the broader DeFi landscape.
