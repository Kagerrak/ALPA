# Buy and Sell Tax

## Taxation Mechanism on ALPA Token Transactions

In a bid to perpetually fuel the treasuries and ensure the sustainable operation of Altered Paradigm, a taxation mechanism is implemented on ALPA token transactions.

### Tax on Buying/Selling ALPA Tokens

A 6% tax is levied on each buy/sell transaction of the ALPA token. This tax is directly funneled into the treasuries, thereby steadily augmenting their financial prowess. This mechanism ensures:

- **Sustainability**: A constant influx of funds into the treasuries, maintaining and enhancing their capabilities.
- **Stability**: Ensuring the Backing Treasury is continuously fortified, enhancing the stability of the ALPA token.
- **Growth**: Permitting the Investment Treasury to perpetually identify and capitalize on lucrative investment opportunities.

This taxation mechanism ensures that the Altered Paradigm ecosystem continually thrives, bolstering its stability and facilitating perpetual growth. It underpins the projectâ€™s vision of establishing a platform where stability and growth are not mutually exclusive but coexist, prosper, and perpetually fuel each other, crafting a narrative of collective success and sustainability.
