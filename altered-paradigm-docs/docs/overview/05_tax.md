# Buy and Sell Tax

## Taxation Mechanism on ALPA Token Transactions

To support the ongoing stability and growth of the Altered Paradigm ecosystem, a taxation mechanism is applied to ALPA token transactions.

### Tax on Buying/Selling ALPA Tokens

A 6% tax is imposed on each buy and sell transaction of the ALPA token. Unlike traditional taxation mechanisms where the tax is used to fuel the treasuries, in Altered Paradigm, this tax is **burned**, directly impacting the total circulating supply of ALPA tokens.

#### Impact of the Taxation Mechanism:

- **Reduction in Circulating Supply**: The burning of 6% of each transaction reduces the total circulating supply of ALPA tokens, influencing the token's scarcity and value.

- **Enhancing the Floor Price**: The reduction in circulating supply due to the burning mechanism positively impacts the Floor Price of the ALPA token, potentially leading to an increase in its intrinsic value.

- **Promoting Long-Term Stability**: By reducing the circulating supply, this mechanism contributes to the long-term stability and sustainability of the ALPA token, aligning with the project's vision of enduring growth and stability.

This taxation mechanism plays a crucial role in ensuring that the Altered Paradigm ecosystem not only thrives but also maintains a balance between stability and growth. It represents a strategic approach to tokenomics, where the burning of the transaction tax contributes to the overall health and longevity of the ALPA token, fostering a sustainable and prosperous ecosystem for all stakeholders.
