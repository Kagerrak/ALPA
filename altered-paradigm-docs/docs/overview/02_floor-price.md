# Floor Price Mechanism

In the vast and volatile domain of cryptocurrency, Altered Paradigm introduces a stabilizing anchor in the form of the **Floor Price** mechanism. Ingeniously engineered, this mechanism instills an intrinsic value to the ALPA token, providing a foundational safety net amidst market oscillations and ensuring a sustained stability for investors and token holders.

## Establishing the Floor Price

The Floor Price is conceptualized as a fundamental value, beneath which the price of the ALPA token is structurally supported not to fall. This is safeguarded by maintaining a substantial and perpetually augmenting **Backing Treasury**, which holds considerable assets to substantiate the intrinsic value of each circulating ALPA token.

This concept ensures each token is perennially backed by actual value, providing assurance and stability to the token holders.

## The Growing Backing Treasury

### Transaction Tax and Its Impact on Supply

A 6% transaction tax is applied to each buy and sell of the ALPA token. This tax is **burned**, directly impacting the total circulating supply of ALPA tokens.

- **Burning Mechanism:** The burning of 6% of each transaction effectively reduces the total circulating supply, which in turn influences the Floor Price and the scarcity of the ALPA token.

- **Enhancing Floor Price:** As the total circulating supply decreases due to the burning mechanism, the Floor Price of the ALPA token is positively impacted, potentially leading to an increase in its value.

### Investment Proceeds Enhancing the Treasury

The **Investment Treasury** also plays a significant role in enhancing the Floor Price. A dedicated portion of the profits generated from various investment activities is strategically redirected into the Backing Treasury, perpetually elevating the Floor Price and further solidifying the stability and intrinsic value of the ALPA token.

## Ensuring Stability and Confidence

The Floor Price mechanism, fortified by a continuously growing Backing Treasury, ensures that ALPA token holders can invest and transact with confidence, knowing that their assets are backed by a tangible safety net. This innovative mechanism allows Altered Paradigm to offer a stable, secure, and promising environment amidst the typically turbulent cryptocurrency market, thereby altering the paradigm of digital asset investment and establishing a new benchmark for stability and growth.

## Info: Calculating the Floor Price

The Floor Price is derived through a straightforward formula, ensuring transparency and easy verification for all stakeholders:

\[
\text{Floor Price} = \frac{\text{Total Assets in Backing Treasury}}{\text{Total Circulating Supply of ALPA Tokens}}
\]

Where:

- **Total Assets in Backing Treasury**: Represents the total value of all assets held within the Backing Treasury.
- **Total Circulating Supply of ALPA Tokens**: Denotes the total number of ALPA tokens currently in circulation.

This formula transparently ties the Floor Price to the tangible assets held within the Backing Treasury, ensuring a clear and verifiable intrinsic value for every ALPA token.
