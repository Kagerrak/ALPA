# Fair Market Value

Understanding the dynamics of Altered Paradigm's financial ecosystem necessitates a comprehension of key metrics and valuations. One such pivotal metric is the **Fair Market Value (FMV)** of the ALPA token, providing a nuanced view of its value derived from the comprehensive financial standing of the protocol's treasury.

## What is ALPA's Fair Market Value?

In the context of Altered Paradigm, there are distinctive prices that stakeholders need to be cognizant of, each serving a specific purpose and reflecting different aspects of the protocol's financial status:

- **Floor Price:** Previously discussed, this is the price at which ALPA tokens can be redeemed, serving as a safety net and stabilizing mechanism.

- **Fair Market Value:** The FMV is a nuanced metric, calculated by dividing the combined net asset value (NAV) of the treasury by the total circulating supply of ALPA tokens.

- **Combined Treasury Net Asset Value (NAV):** Represents the total value of all assets (such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other investments) held within the treasury, minus any liabilities or debts.

- **Total Circulating Supply of ALPA Tokens:** Denotes the total number of ALPA tokens currently in circulation within the market.

## Significance of Fair Market Value

### Comprehensive Value Insight:

- **Holistic Perspective:** The FMV provides a holistic perspective on the per-token value of the entire financial reservoir of Altered Paradigm.

- **Intrinsic Value Indicator:** While the floor price serves as a safety net, the FMV provides insight into the intrinsic value of the ALPA token, reflecting the overall financial health and asset backing of the protocol.

### Strategic Planning:

- **Investment Decisions:** FMV can guide investors in making informed decisions, providing a transparent view of the intrinsic value per ALPA token.

- **Protocol Health Indicator:** For the protocol and its strategists, the FMV serves as a barometer for the financial health and sustainability of Altered Paradigm, influencing future strategies and decisions.

### Community Confidence:

- **Transparency:** Offering a transparent mechanism to evaluate the per-token value of the treasury’s assets.

- **Trust:** The clear and verifiable calculation of FMV fosters trust among the community and stakeholders.

## In a Nutshell:

The Fair Market Value isn’t merely a static metric; it’s a reflection of Altered Paradigm’s financial robustness, strategic asset management, and overall health of the protocol. By understanding and monitoring the FMV, stakeholders, investors, and strategists alike can navigate, plan, and engage with the protocol in a manner that’s informed, strategic, and aligned with both individual and collective aspirations.
