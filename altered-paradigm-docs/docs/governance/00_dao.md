# Governance & DAO

Altered Paradigm is not merely a decentralized finance project; it's a community-driven initiative where the direction and strategies of the project are sculpted by its members through a democratic, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure.

## Progressive Decentralization

### Philosophy

In a world that's perpetually evolving, Altered Paradigm adheres to a philosophy of **"progressive decentralization."** While certain facets of the protocol are presently governed at a macro level by the DAO, the ultimate objective revolves around solidifying a foundation at the Treasury, Policy, and economic echelons. This enables the community to directly maneuver protocol mechanics in a manner that minimizes reliance on trust and processes.

### Future Vision

The vision extends beyond mere decentralization, aspiring to empower the community to steer the protocol towards horizons that align with collective aspirations and values, ensuring that Altered Paradigm not only thrives but also reflects the will of its community.

## Preliminary Governance Through Snapshot

### Voting Mechanism

While the bespoke governance platform is under development, Altered Paradigm will utilize **Snapshot** for community voting, ensuring that every voice within the community is heard and valued.

- **Snapshot Voting:** All voting will transpire through Snapshot, a decentralized governance tool that ensures every vote, every voice, is counted without the need for on-chain transactions.
- **Token-Based Voting:** Voting power is determined by the quantity of ALPA tokens held in a wallet, ensuring a democratic and decentralized voting process.

### Transparent and Inclusive

Snapshot not only enables transparent and verifiable voting but also allows for inclusive community participation, ensuring that the path Altered Paradigm treads is paved by the collective will of its community.

## Upcoming Governance Platform

### Web3 Wallet Integration

The imminent governance platform will integrate Web3 wallet signature logins, aligning with the decentralized ethos of Altered Paradigm.

- **Simple Login:** Engage with the governance platform effortlessly by connecting and signing with your Web3 wallet.

- **Transparent Participation:** The transparent mechanism ensures that governance is not only decentralized but also easily accessible and verifiable.

### Steps Towards Robust Governance

#### Governance Steps:

1. **Idea Initiation:** The inception of ideas begins with an initial discussion thread on the platform, providing a space for community members to express their views and debate potential strategies.
2. **Temperature Check:** After a minimum of 5 days of discussion and token voting, the general sentiment and viability of the idea are assessed.

3. **Proposal Drafting:** If the community sentiment leans towards support, proposers advance to draft an official proposal, ensuring that it encapsulates the collective will and discussions of the community.

4. **Community Review:** Drafts are opened up for community review, allowing for further refinements and inputs before proceeding to an on-chain vote.

5. **On-Chain Voting:** Proposals, post community vetting, are moved to on-chain voting, where every staked ALPA token holder gets to cast their vote, steering Altered Paradigm towards a future that reflects the collective will.

### In a Nutshell:

Altered Paradigm is not just a protocol; itâ€™s a community, where every member has a voice, every opinion is valued, and every vote counts. Through decentralized governance, Altered Paradigm is not only altering financial paradigms but also how decentralized finance is governed, ensuring it is truly by the community, for the community.
